# Galactic Bloodshed

Galactic Bloodshed is one of the oldest games on the Internet and was one of the first 4-X games.

## Getting Started

GB is currently hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/kaladron/galactic-bloodshed.  It uses Bazel
for building.

### Prerequisites

GB uses C++20, so a modern compiler and standard library are required.
Bazel must be installed on the system.
Two Boost libraries are required.
