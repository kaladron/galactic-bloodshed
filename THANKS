Racegen
 * Thanks to:
 * Clay Luther for the original, (perl) racegen.  I made sure to look at it
 *   before starting this, and in got much of the linear aspects of my
 *   attribute cost functions from his program.  Also, the 125 IQ is Clay's.
 * Keesh, for the numbers, too.  At least, Clay thanks him for them, so I
 *   think I should too.
 * Paul A Daniels for pointing out that help displayed plated as a possible
 *   argument for modify.
 * jtop@cs.kun.nl for the race with gas and other compats too.  My blind spot.
 * Doug Ingram for suggesting more game-dependent info be included.
