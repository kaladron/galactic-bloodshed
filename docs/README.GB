	This is version GB 5.0 HUT release.
The major changes in this code are documented in README.HUT


	Your first step is to run Configure.  Either type Configure
or sh Configure, your choice.   It will go through and ask you some
questions about your system, and the host that GB will run on and the
port and such.  The only questions you really gotta watch out for
and make sure are right are:

	the hostname and domaniname
	the port
	and where the datafiles are to be kept.

	Out of all of them the datafiles is the most important.  The default
should be fine in most cases.  (it will take your current directory).

	After you answer all the questions, it will extract the Makefiles,
and perform a few symbolic links.  (the links are for the utilites 
programs, which share some of the server modules.)

	After all the Makefiles are extracted and the links are made you
should inspect the hdrs/files.h and hdrs/config.h files to make sure
the look ok.  If you dont know what they are supposed to look like,
assume they are ok!  *wink*


	Well... now for the moment of truth...

	From the top level directory (where this file resides), type

	make all

	You should see it changing into the various directorys, and do
the compiles.  After it is done...  you should type...


	make install


	This will take all the binaries, (GB, enrol, makeuniv) and the
support files, (planet.list, welcome.txt, ship.dat) and place the
whole deal in the bin directory.

	THATS IT!!  Just cd to bin, and start things up...

	Run a makeuniv, to set up the universe, and then start enrolling
players either with the racegen program or the enrol program.

	If you need to debug the user files (via dbx or gbx or whatever),
use the make target GBX.  This will not link with a library, and instead
will link with all the .o files in user.  (The list of the .o files, is
maintained in ./user/OBJECTS.
