ACTIONPOINTS		Galactic Bloodshed		ACTIONPOINTS


CONCEPT: actionpoints

  Action Points are built up slowly by the player's presence in a solar
system.  They are a mechanism to represent the `bureaucratic grind' of
a star-spanning government. Every command uses a certain number of action 
points; some commands, being observatory in nature, use none.  

  A player's action points for each system are displayed in his prompt when
his scope is in that system (changed by the ``cs'' command). The action point 
cost of each command can be found just before it's listing in each document 
entry.
 Each solar system and the galactic level earn APs on every update for 
a player based on population and number of ships. When you run out of APs in a
system, you are unable to do anything in that system.  APs can be reallocated
from the galactic (global) level to a particular system, but that is usually
reserved for important situations as global APs are a rare and precious
commodity.
