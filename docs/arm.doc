ARM                    Galactic Bloodshed                    ARM


NAME
   arm [0] -- convert civilian population to military units

SYNTAX
   arm <sector x,y> [<# of civs to arm>]

DESCRIPTION
    The arm command transforms civilians into military units. The 
current scope must be a planet and a sector coordinates must be 
specified. This maximum number able to be armed is given by the 
formula:

        maxarm = (planet destruct x (2 * sector mobilization + 1))

but can not exceed the population of the sector; e.g. if you 
have 20d on a planet and the sector's mobilization is 5, a total 
of 220 civs could be armed. If you specify a number of civs to 
arm greater than maxarm , only maxarm  will be armed. If the 
number of civs to convert is not specified, maxarm   or the 
total population of the sector is armed, whichever is less.
    Arming a sector also costs money. The method used to compute 
the total cost of arming is selected by the deity before the 
game begins. Typical methods charge a constant amount (default 
is 5) per unit armed, or charge money equal to the race's fight 
characteristic per unit armed. The default method is to use the 
fight characteristic; e.g. if you armed 120 civs whose fight 
value is 6, you need 720 money to arm them. If you do not have 
the required amount of money to arm the number you specify, no 
civs will be armed.
    Use the disarm command to reverse the transformation. Distruct 
used to arm is lost and is not regained by the use of disarm.

EXAMPLE:
arm 1,5 20  (arm 20 civs from sector 1,5; will cost (20/(sector 
                mob * 2 + 1)) destruct and (20 x 5) money)
            (for this example, if mob. = 1 and cost = constant 5 
                costs 7d and 100 money)
