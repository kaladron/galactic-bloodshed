AUTO-MOVEMENT (hopping)

TKY's are moving themselves once they consider their job done in
sector they are landed. They will move to the most suitable sector to
continue their job. Command 'order <ships> limit n' could be used to
control their decision to move and command 'order <ships> hop
[on|off]' could be used to turn auto-movement on or off.
  Terraformers will terraform the sector they are landed on in one
segment so 'limit n' setting is used to control the selection of the
next sector to terraform: value n (in per cents) will limit their
activity to sectors that has compatibility less that n% for your
race. So if you have compatibilities 100% of land and 70% for water
you should give 'order T limit 70' to prevent water sectors from being
terraformed. T's will 1st look if there is suitable target sector that
you own if not unowned sector are searched. If T hops to unowned
sector that sector will be randomly chosen to prevent other players to
predict where your T is going to be after update. NOTE: you can still
T's move orders - move orders will be evaluated first and then auto-hop
so using move and hop at same time could lead to quite confusing
results.
  Space plows will do auto-hop if the sector they are landed on has
higher fertility that their limit setting. As with T's player's own
sectors are preferred and old move code is still working. K's will hop
to sector that has lowest fertility (even if it is higher than its
limit setting - so you could give 'order K limit 1', K's will hop in
every update but you planet will end up 100% fert in each sector) if
all player's own sectors has 100% fert K's will hop to any sector that
has any compatibility and has lowest fert. If there are more than one
sector that has minimum fertility value target sector will be chosen
by random.
  Domes will auto-hop if the sector they are landed on has higher
efficiency than their limit setting is. They will hop only to player's
own sectors. Sector of lowest eff is chosen and if there is more than
one sector with same eff target will be chosen by random.
