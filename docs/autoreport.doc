AUTOREPORT                 Galactic Bloodshed                  AUTOREPORT


NAME
   autoreport [0] -- toggle automatic update reports from a planet

SYNTAX
   autoreport <planet>

DESCRIPTION
    This command toggles the automatic reporting feature of a 
planet. The single parameter is optional, but must be a valid 
planet scope if specified. If not specified, the current scope 
must be a planet.
    When autoreport is set for a planet, a telegram will be sent at 
each update to the planet owner describing the production, 
discoveries, and status of the planet. To avoid an overflow of 
unread telegrams, the reports will be only be sent for a set 
number of updates after the autoreport command is executed. This 
number can be changed by the deity, but the default value causes 
the planet to report to the owner for seven updates before 
automatically shutting off. If you wish the reports to continue, 
you must execute autoreport again.
