BID                       Galactic Bloodshed                      BID


NAME
   bid [0] -- list market items and make a bid

SYNTAX
   bid [ <resource type> | <lot #> <bid> ]

DESCRIPTION
    Use the bid command to check the Galactic Bloodshed Commodities 
Market for current resources being sold or to place a bid on one 
of the lot numbers. Without arguments, this command lists all 
the lots currently on the market. If you specify a commodity 
type as a single argument (r, f, x, d), you will get a list of 
only those lots selling that commodity. When you decide to place 
a bid, specify both the lot number and the amount you wish to 
offer; you must have the money before you place the bid. The money 
will not be subtracted from your account until you win the bid 
and the goods are sold to you--you must still have enough money 
then! The race with the highest bid on the second update after 
the lot appears on the market wins the bidding. A lot will have 
a '*' next to it's lot number if it has been on the market for 
one update--it will be sold the following update.
    When you place a bid, you must be at a planet scope and that 
planet must be under your control. Furthermore, you must have a 
ship which is able to receive shipments on or in orbit around 
the planet. Currently, only five ships can serve as shipping 
docks: @, a government center; S, a station; H, a habitat; J, a 
space port; and !, a god-ship. Upon winning a bid, the goods 
will be delivered to this scope.
    With the defaults, you must bid 10% higher than the previous 
bid on a lot for your offer to be accepted, but this value can be 
changed by the deity. You will be notified if you have been 
outbid by another player. Keep in mind that there is also a 
shipping charge for the transfer of the commodity. If you can 
not pay the shipping on the update when the lot is sold to you, 
your race will loose morale equal to the amount you are short, 
divided by ten--this loss is equivalent to the moral loss when 
you are unable to maintain your ships and troops. The shipping 
charge is given by the formula:

        shipping = ( 1.0 - Exp[ - (rdist/dc) ] ) * bid
        
where rdist is the distance between then bidder and seller star 
systems, rounded to the 10,000s (e.g. 435,304 -> 430,000), and 
dc is a distance constant set by the deity (the default is 
200,000).

EXAMPLE:
bid d               (List all lots selling destruct)
bid 5 10000         (Bid 10,000 on lot number 5)
