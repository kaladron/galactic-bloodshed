BLOCK                    Galactic Bloodshed                     BLOCK


NAME
   block [0] -- display list of power blocks

SYNTAX
   block [<block leader #> | player <race> ]

CONCEPT
 Each race may lead one alliance block.
Alliance blocks do not force alliances among its members.
In fact, it solely is used for political purposes. However, an
alliance block can win the game by accumulating the required number
of victory points.

DESCRIPTION
    With no arguments, the block command lists all alliance groups, 
called power blocks, that are in effect. Each group is listed 
with its current stats as estimated by your race's knowledge of 
that group's leader.
    Blocks are numbered by the race number of their leader. If 
block is called with a single number for an argument, the report 
will list all of that particular block's members and their stats 
as estimated by your race.
    If the keyword {{player}} and a number are specified with the block 
command, that race's status with regard to power blocks is 
reported: which, if any, block the race belongs to, whether it 
has been invited to join a block, or whether it has pledged a 
block.

EXAMPLE:
block player 21         (List the block status of race 21)
block player Neighbors  (List the block status of Neighbors)
block 12                (List all members and stats of power block 12)
