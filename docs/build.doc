SYNTAX
Current Scope       Syntax

Planet:		(I)	build <ship type> <sector x,y> [<# to build>]
Factory:  	(II)	build [<# to build>]
Other Ship:     (II)	build <ship type> [<# to build>]
Any scope:         	build ? [<ship type>]

DESCRIPTION
    The build command allows a race to convert their stored 
resources into useful machinery. Many different types of ships, 
buildings, devices, and weapons can be built in Galactic 
Bloodshed, each with its own special characteristics and 
abilities. Due to the complex design of ships in the game, this 
command has several variants, each of which will be discussed 
below. At a minimum, for every build variant, a race must have 
the minimum technology level and resources on hand to create the 
specified ship.
    Each ship has a default set of parameters which can be listed 
by using the command build ?. This variant can be executed at 
any scope. Without any argument, this command will print a table 
of all the default parameters for all ship types. Given a 
specific ship type, this variant will print a short description 
of the ship, where the ship can be built, and the default 
parameters for that ship.
 Some ships are built with a damage. Ships repair themselves 
at rate 24% every update if there is resourses and civilians in
ship or on sector where ship is landed on.
    The other variants of the build command arise since ships can 
be built in a variety of locations in Galactic Bloodshed: on a 
planet surface, in factories, in other ships, or in space by 
other ships. Certain ship types have restricted build locations. 
Use the build ? command to see where a ship may be built. There 
are currently five build locations for ships.
 On a Planet
 In a Factory: F
 In Hanger of some ships
 In Habitat
 Outside some Ships

    The first class of ships can use the first build variant (I) 
when the current scope is set to a planet. The sector the ship 
is built in must be specified along with the ship type. A race 
must be above the minimum technology level to build the ship and 
must have the resources available in the planetary stores. The 
planet must not be enslaved to another race. A governor who 
attempts to build on a planet must have control over that 
planet. The specified sector must be owned by the builder, have 
at least one civilian on the sector, and not be wasted. A second 
Quarry (q) cannot be built on a sector.
    The second class of ships must be built in Factories (F). A 
brief summary of the building of these ships follows below (for 
a more detailed description, see the manual section on ships):

   1) A Factory (F) must be built. Factories can be built on 
    planets or in Habitats--refer to the appropriate paragraph in 
    this command to build a Factory. The rest of this summary 
    assumes the Factory is on a planet. Factories on Habitats 
    function similarly.
   2) Change scope  to the Factory.
   3) Decide which ship types this Factory will produce and execute 
    the make command at this scope.
   4) The design specifications may be changed via the modify 
    command at this scope.
   5) Once the design has been set, order the Factory on. An 
    initial start-up cost for the Factory will be extracted from the 
    planet's resource stockpile. This cost is twice the resources 
    needed to build its specified ship. The type of ship produced 
    and the design specifications cannot be changed once the Factory 
    is online!
   6) Factories are built with 48% - 75% damage. They do not require 
    resources to be fixed but will repair themselves over the course 
    of several updates--{{but only after they have been ordered online}}.
   7) Once the Factory is completely repaired, change scope to the 
    Factory again. The second build command variant (II)
    can now be executed to produce ships from the Factory. 
    The planet must have sufficient resources to produce the ships. 
    The ships will appear on the same sector of the planet as the Factory.

    The third and fourth class, when built, appear in the hanger of 
the building ship. The current scope must be set to the building 
ship, where the third build variant (III) can be used to 
construct the ships. The building ship must have adequate hanger 
space and resources for the ship to be built.
    The fifth class of ships are built outside of the constructing 
ship, and thus hanger space is not a factor. The third build 
variant (III) is used for this class also. The building ships of 
this class cannot construct ships when landed. Shuttles (s) can 
be loaded with more resources than their specified maximum, but 
they cannot land while overloaded (see the related command 
load). These resources can then be used to make the large ships 
in this class.
 
EXAMPLE:
build F 5,4     (Build a Factory at sector 5,4. Current scope must 
                    be a planet)
build : 5       (Build five Space Probes inside a ship's hanger)
