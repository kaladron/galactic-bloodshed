SYNTAX
    capital [#shipnum]

DESCRIPTION
	Your capital is a "Governmental Center" ship which produces action 
points as the workings of a government.  It is possible to maintain more than
one governmental center in your empire for use as backups in case something
should happen to your capital (of course, they are very expensive).

	Without a capital, no AP's will be produced.  Also if the capital
is damaged or understaffed the government will experience a slowdown
in proportion to its handicap.  

	If no argument is specified, the current efficiency of your capital
is displayed.  This is proportional to the number of crew (officials working
in the capital) and the damage of the capital. Efficiency does not
influence acttionpoints production however.
