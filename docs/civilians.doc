CIVILIANS		Galactic Bloodshed		CIVILIANS


Civilians and military are two different type representives of your race.
 
 Civilians have a fighting strength equal to your race's fight.  
Military have fighting strength 10 times stronger than your civilians.  
 Contrary to what you might think, military cannot pilot ships or fire 
guns...only civilians can do that. Thus, if you have 5 guns on your 
explorer and 2 mil and 3 crew, you will only be able to fire 3 guns at 
a time.  Also, if you have only mil on board a given ship (ie. your only 
civ on board gets killed by a lucky shot from an enemy), you cannot order 
the ship to any destination.
 Only civilians can multiply, so if you inhabit sector with military only
it's population will not grow. It will not decrease either becouse
military can survive on non compatible sectors. Sector efficiency and
fertility will stay as it is also.
 You can turn military back to civilians by disarming them. No money or
destruction can be recovered.
