COMBAT			Galactic Bloodshed			COMBAT


DESCRIPTION

   'move' and 'deploy' commands are used to move civilians/troops from one 
sector to an adjacent sector. If a destination sector is occupied by 
aliens, the combat strengths of the player (attacker) and alien (defender) 
are computed. The combat strengths depend on number of beings, fighting 
ability, sector terrain and technology of the races according to the
formula

strength = [(civ) * (fighting ability) + (troops) * (fighting ability) * 10]
	* (sector compatibility factor) * (terrain defense factor)
	* morale_factor(difference of race morales)

The assault is evaluated and casualties are removed from each sector.

   The origin sector is where the people will begin to move from. This must
be occupied by the player.

 Attacking commands are:
    deploy <origin sector x,y> <direction> <number of troops>
    move <origin sector x,y> <direction> <number of civilians>

   If number of civs/troops argument is not given, all in the 
original sector will be moved. If a negative number is specified, the all 
civs or troops, except for the amount specified, will move. 

   If mesomorphic races are involved in the combat, and are victorious,
by either taking the assaulted sector or repulsing an attack, they may
absorb alien bodies, adding to their own numbers. Note that all enemy
casualties are converted to civilians (not troops!).

	Defense strengths of terrain:
		land  = 1
		sea   = 1
		mount = 3    wasted = 0
		gas   = 2
		ice   = 2
		forest= 3
		desert= 2
		plate = 4

 Attacking is not possible on planets that have been enslaved to another race.

   Moving civilians uses up more action points than moving troops.
