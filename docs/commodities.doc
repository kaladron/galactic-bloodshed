COMMODITIES                Galactic Bloodshed                COMMODITIES


RESOURCE
 Resource is the basic commodity, which is needed to build and fix ships 
and repair wasted sectors.
 Each sector have resource deposity. You can mine these by inhabiting sector.
Amount of produced resources depends mostly on sector efficiency, secondly
races metabolism and of course when deposity is getting empty production will 
declerate. Resource production is most important thing among expanding 
your empire to succeed in game. Often, races with low metabolism and/or
small homeworls or worse, a combination of the two, will take painfully
long to start generating any.
 There is two ships that can turn fuel to resources. Chemistry plant y 
(y is not wery often in games) and space habitat H. H uses 20 fuels
to make one resource (this rate depends on game settings however). 

FUEL
 Fuel is the energy source of all ships. Also lasers use fuel to 
attack with. 2 points of fuel is equivalent to 1 light gun.
 Sectors produces fuel just like and as much as resources. One exception 
is jovian sectors which produces double amount of fuel. Ships orbitting
jovian planet can also suck fuel from jovian atmosphere. Tanker ships
are especially effective on this, they can scoop 1/5 of tanker room 
fuel each update. 

DESTRUCTION
 Destructive potential is what guns shoot. Arming toops requires 
destruction also.
 There is two ways to create destruction. Weapons plant W is a ship
that produces it (1 fuel + 1 resource = 1 destruction). One W can
only make tech/2 amount of destruction every update. Another way to
produce destruction is to rise sector mobilization. On such a sector
part of resource production pops up directly as destruction.
