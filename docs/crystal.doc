CRYSTAL                 Galactic Bloodshed                      CRYSTAL

CONCEPT

   When the universe is created, some sectors on planets may contain
crystal deposits denoted by a 'x'. As long as there are crystals in
a sector the symbol remains on the sector. Through their explorations
players will find sectors that have these deposits although they
can never know exactly how many crystals are hidden in the sector.

   When a player occupies a sector with crystal deposits in them, during
the update, his race will attempt to find crystals. The probability of
success per update is equal to the sector efficiency. During an update,
the planet's total crystal production can be determined by setting
autoreport. A line telling how many crystals are in the players stockpiles
also will appear on map.

   Crystals are like the other commodities, population, resources, fuel,
and destruct. They may be loaded and unloaded from ships as for other
commodities. They may also be captured just like other commodities.

  If a ship with hyper-drive has at least one crystal on board, the player
may mount the crystal into the hyper-drive (see help on the 'mount' 
command). Only one crystal needs to be mounted. However a player may
carry more if he/she chooses. If a player has a crystal mounted in the
hyper-drive, the ship does not need to recharge, it is always considered
to be charged for hyper-space jump during the update. The crystal also
allows the ship to travel longer distances due to fuel efficiency.

  Crystals in the hyper-drive also allows a player to use laser-beam-
like weapons. These weapons, however, will consume fuel, not destruct
to operate. These weapons have the same effect as normal fire, except
there is no limit to how much fuel you may expend in an attack.

  Players should be careful of the amount of fuel they wish to put
through a crystal at anytime. Crystals may break, rendering them useless,
or, in extreme cases, cause the detonation of the ship they are in,
along with everything else nearby.

 The maximum safe limit of fuel passing through a crystal depends
on ships tech. For every point of fuel passed through above (shiptech/2)
increases chance breaking it and every point of fuel passed throug
above (shiptech) increases chance of blowing up the ship!
