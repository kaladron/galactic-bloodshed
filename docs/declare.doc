DECLARE			Galactic Bloodshed		DECLARE


NAME
   declare [0] -- state relations with other races
 
SYNTAX
   declare <race> <status> 

DESCRIPTION
  The friction between two disparate races competing for the same limited
resources may be such that no matter what diplomatic means exist between
them (telegram), conflict may still ensue.  

  To facilitate this, a player may declare his/her race's intentions toward
other races in the game, whether allied, neutral, or at war.

  When invoked, a prompt will ask how he wishes his relations to be with that 
racer, and the race number.  This will be in effect until the user changes
his/her mind.

  A race's relation state affects the way a few things happen in the game:

  - A ship following another will 'lose sight' of that ship at a certain
distance, if the other ship is not an ally.
  - Mines look for ships belonging to enemy players.  If it finds one within
	its trigger radius, it will detonate.
  - A player is prompted when firing on or boarding (assault) a ship 
	belonging to an ally.
  - Allied ships and planets do not return fire.
  - When bombard is set on a ship, that ship will fire at sectors owned by
	players the owner is at war with.  If there are no such, it finds
	players with which the owner is neutral.

You may declare war, alliance, or neutrality.
