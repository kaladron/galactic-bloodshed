NAME
   deploy [variable] -- Move military from one sector to another. 

SYNTAX
   deploy <origin sector x,y> <direction list> <number of troops>

DESCRIPTION
   This command is used to move troops from one sector to an adjacent
sector. The player enters the origination sector, target sector, and the
amount of troops to move. If a destination sector is occupied by 
aliens, the combat strengths of the player (attacker) and alien (defender) 
are computed. See 'combat' for detalis.

   If number of troops argument is not  given, all troops in the original 
sector will be moved. If a negative troops is specified, the all troops,
except for the amount specified, will move. 

  The direction orders the group to move in one of 8 compass directions:
					
				7   8   9
				 \  |  /
				  \ | /
 			       4 -- . -- 6
				  / | \
				 /  |  \
				1   2   3
The troops will continue to move as long as a valid move is available.
Movement stops when an illegal move, lost/draw combat, or lack of
action points occurs. For example, 'move 10,4 6698 -2' will leave two
peopl behind in sector 10,4 move the rest to 11,4, leave 2, move the rest
to 12,4, leave 2, move the rest to 11,3, leave 2, finish the move to 11,2.
This would cost 4 APs.

   This command cannot be used on planets that have been enslaved to another
player.

   Moving civilians uses up more action points than moving troops.
