        "GB" stands for "Galactic Bloodshed."  It is a multiplayer galactic
exploration, colonization and conquest game. GB is a game played
on a network by several users at various sites.  The home site, where
the game and its database reside, is generally referred to as the
"server."

The Game

At the beginning of the game, a player selects the type of race and home 
planet he would like.  There are two major types of races: mesomorphs 
metamorphs) and techies.  Techies are normal humaniod races.  Mesos can 
absorp people, and have a group consciousness.
 Home worlds range from asteriods to gas giants though the players on tiny 
planets tend to not do well.

In the early phases of the game, it is important to build large populations
on as many planets as possible.  This involves investing in
technology, exploration, and developing planets.  

The game from there goes in the next stage where players begin meeting each
other and either fighting or forming alliances.  As the games progresses, 
some races die off and a few players or alliances usually start dominating 
the game.  Ships, also, get more and more powerful.

Basic Rules

GB operates on an update (or turn) basis.  Each update is also broken into
movements.  When a player performs an action, it may occur immediately or 
wait until the next movement or update.  An example of an immediate action
is firing a laser or loading cargo into a ship.  On movements, ships 
actually move. On an update, ships move, jump through hyperspace, 
populations increase or decrease, pollution increases, technology level goes
up, taxes are earned, and maintenance is paid among other things.

 Each solar system and the galactic level earn APs on every update for 
a player based on population and number of ships.  Almost any action uses 
APs. When you run out of APs in a system, you are unable to do anything in 
that system.  

How to start Playing

The first step is to start reading alt.games.gb.  The FAQ will fill in a lot
of the gaps in this article.  The client and server code is available on

ftp://courses.cstudies.ubc.ca/pub/gb. 

Then you have to find a game.  The best thing to do is to wait for a new 
game starting up.  They are usually posted on alt.games.gb.  Sometimes there
are newbie games.  Please, however, do not play unless you are sure that you
can regularly spend the time playing.  If you turn out to be wrong, give 
your race over to another player.  Races dropping out in the middle of the 
game can unbalance a game pretty badly.

Conclusion

GB is fun, but dangerously addictive.  Also, it demands serious time
commitments from its players.  If you decide to play, just remember it is 
only a game.

            Finally, remember that the deity of the game is there to
     help you.  If it weren't for him/her, you wouldn't be playing GB
     at all.  So don't whine.  Be polite.  Make constructive comments.
     It'll be easier for everyone that way.
