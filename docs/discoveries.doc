DISCOVERIES                 Galactic Bloodshed                   DISCOVERIES


 In some tech races discovers different new equpments they may use now on.
Here is list of them with required tech:

Hyper-drive 50      - After this you may upgrade or build new ships 
	              with hyper-drive engine.

Crystal 80          - Crystal energy source. You may use crystal along
                      with fuel to make much faster and longer hyperjumps.

Laser 100           - Light-beam weapon that will use fuel instead of

CEW 150             - Confined energy weapons, which unlike lasers and guns
		      can be designed to have an optimal range. 

AVPM 200	    - Audio-Vibatory-Physio-Molecular Transport Device.
                      This will transport loaded material into the hopper of 
		      its target device.
