NAME
   enslave [1] -- enslave a world
 
SYNTAX
   enslave <shipnumber>

DESCRIPTION
  This command is used to convert entire planets to a condition of slavery.
When invoked the ship specified must be an Orbital Assault Platform, which
is the only ship type sufficiently impressive to convince the planetary
population of the futility of resistance.  The platform must be orbiting
the planet to be enslaved.

  To commence a proper enslavement, the forces bearing (the platform itself
plus the other ships which might be orbiting the planet) against the
planet must be more than twice the defending strength (weapons under the
control of the inhabitants plus the weapons on board any ships they own in
orbit around the planet).  The enslaving player must have a garrison (at
least one population) on the planet.  

  The enslaving player is not told how much strength the other players might
have, but he is told whether the planet was enslaved or not.  Telegram
messages are sent to any players affected by the command.

  To keep the planet the enslaving player must maintain a garrison of at
least 0.1% of the total population on the planet.  (The garrison need not be
that large to initiate slavery, but must be that large to maintain it.)
If the garrison falls below this threshold, and the OAP is no longer in
orbit around the planet, a revolution is immediate and devastating:
all sectors belonging to the former slave holder are destroyed in the
inhabitants' fury of revolution.  If the OAP is still there, there is a
chance (50%) that a revolution will not occur, and some occupying sectors
may not be destroyed (without it overhead, they will be).  Other random
sectors will be damaged as well in the fight.

  When a planet is under enslavement, everything produced there will be
credited to the slave-holding player's stockpiles.  Races enslaved on a
planet can still survey, map, and otherwise observe things happening
there (there is an active resistance).
