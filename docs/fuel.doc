NAME
   fuel [0] -- show how much fuel ordered travel needs

SYNTAX
   fuel <#ship> <destination>

DESCRIPTION
   The fuel command is used to obtain information about how much fuel
traveling to a destination consumes. Command also gives you the time (in
segments) how long the trip will take.

   Ship must either have a destination in its orders or you can give
destination with command. If you give destination the command will show
the time and fuel needed to that destination but orders of the ship are
left unchanged.

   The amount of fuel consumed depends from the speed of the ship. Higher
speeds use more fuel to cover the same distance. Relative amount of fuel
used with different speeds is: 

      speed	    multiplier
	1		1,0	
	2		1,4
	3		1,7
	4		2,0
	5		2,2
	6		2,4
	7		2,6
	8		2,8
	9		3,0

   The amount of fuel consumed depends also from the mass of the ship.
Heavy ships use more fuel than light ships.
