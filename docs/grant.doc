NAME
   grant [0] -- Give a governor something

SYNTAX
   grant <governor #> <what> [amount]

DESCRIPTION  
   This command is used by the race leader to give a governor objects in
the game.  Things that can be "grant"ed include:

     STARS - Granting a star gives the governor the ownership of all population
             in the system.  Anything built, produced, etc. in the system will
             belong to the governor and can be used as the governor wishes.
             Syntax:   "grant <governor #> star /<Star>"

     SHIPS - This will give the governor complete control over the ship(s).
             Any new systems the ship discovers, or any ships it takes over
             will also belong to the governor.  Any number of ships can be
             used with the command.
             Syntax:   "grant <governor #> shipnumber <#shipnumber> ..."

     MONEY - Gives the governor money to be put in the treasury.  Each
             governor has a separate treasury.  Money is used automatically
             in updates for ship up-keep, and can be used for insurgencies.
             Syntax:   "grant <governor #> money <amount>"

   To take any of these items back from the governor, the <governor #> can be
specified as "0".
