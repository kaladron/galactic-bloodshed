HYPERDRIVE		Galactic Bloodshed		HYPERDRIVE



 Hyperdrive is equipment that allows ships to jump through hyper-space,
and travel much much faster than with normal pulsedrive. 

 Destination can be any starsystem in galaxy and once hyperdrive is
charged, jump will happen in one update no matter the distance. Charging
hyperdrive will take two more updates.
  Hypedrive uses a lot more fuel than normal pulsedrive. Amount
of spent fuel follows the formula:

	fuel = 5*mass^0.5*(dist/(200*(tech+100)))^3

So it's obvious that ships fuel capacity limits possible jumping distances.
 If a ship with hyperdrive has at least one crystal on board, the player
may mount the crystal into the hyperdrive (see help on the 'mount' 
command). Only one crystal needs to be mounted. If a player has a crystal 
mounted in the hyperdrive, the ship does not need to recharge, it is always 
considered to be charged for hyper-space jump during the update. The crystal 
also allows the ship to travel longer distances due to fuel efficiency.
Formula with crystal is:

	fuel= 5*mass^0.5*(dist/(200*(tech+100)))^2

  Crystals in the hyperdrive also allows a player to use laser-beam-
like weapons.

HOW TO USE HYPERDRIVE

 1) Your ship need to have hyperdrive. (Some ships can't have it at all). 
Factories built after reaching hyperdrive tech will produce ships
with it. You can also upgrade hyperdrive to ships with 0% damage.
 2) If you have available crystal, load it in ship and mount it.
 3) launch ship (if landed) and order the destination.
 4) Order jump on.

 Now ships hyperdrive will begin to charge. And after third update (with
crystal after next update) you'll find your ship in destination starsystem.
If ship don't have enaugh fuel to do jump, instead of jumping hyperdrive 
will turn off.
