NAME
   [10]insurgency -- try to force enemy population into civil revolt


SYNTAX

insurgency <victim> <funds>   spend a given amount of funds to persuade
                              the population of the victim to throw a 
                              bloody little revolt.

DESCRIPTION

   The insurgency command is used to persuade the population of a planet,
through financial means, that they have had enough of their bloody
dictator and should rise in revolt. This command will only work at planet
scope.  You must have population in that planet's system, before you can
attempt an insurgency.  The probability of a successful insurgency is
given by the following formula: 

 chance = tax factor * inhabiting factor * money factor * minimum money factor

------
					   victim
 tax factor = TAX_RATE * 0.8  +   0.2 *  -------------
					(victim + 1000) 
victim = your victims population in system

 So tax factor will be 0.2 if TAX_RATE is 0% and colony is big.
There is safety factor that keeps tax factor near 0.0 if colony is very small.
--------
				  popula
 inhabiting factor =  sqrt (-------------------)
			     (popula + victim)
popula = your population in system
victim = your victims population in system

 If you have a lot of population in system compared your victims population
chance of successful insurgency will be much higher.
---------
			2 * money
 money factor     =  ---------------
		    (money + colony)

money = amount of money you spend
colony = victim population on colony in question
----------
			     money
 minimum money factor =  --------------
			 (money + 4000)

money = amount of money you spend

 This one prevents attempts to cause revoults too cheap. Factor dissapears
(closes to 1) when amount of movey is big.
----------

  If the attempt fails, some of money spent on it goes to victim and
the rest of it is lost permanently. 
 If the attempt succeeds, each individual sector occupied by the player is
evaluated for revoult. The chance that a sector will revolt is 

revolt chance = compability factor * morale factor * 0.5 * military factor.


compability factor is your compability % to sectortype in question.
morale factor depends on  your and victims morale.
military factor makes succeed harder if there is troops in sector.

If the sector revolts, all troops are killed, and the instigating
player gains control of the sector.
