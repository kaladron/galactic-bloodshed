   [10]insurgency -- try to force enemy population into civil revolt


SYNTAX

insurgency <victim> <funds>   spend a given amount of funds to persuade
                              the population of the victim to throw a 
                              bloody little revolt.

DESCRIPTION

   The insurgency command is used to persuade the population of a planet,
through financial means, that they have had enough of their bloody
dictator and should rise in revolt. This command will only work at planet
scope.  You must have population in that planet's system, before you can
attempt an insurgency.  The probability of a successful insurgency 
depends following things:

victims population in system  
victims population in target planet
victims tax rate in target planet
your population in system
amount of money you spend

It is much viser to try several times with smaller amount of money, than
try one huge investment.

Repair yourself to spend each try about as much money as victims population 
is in target planet.

  If the attempt fails, some of money spent on it goes to victim and
the rest of it is lost permanently. 
 If the attempt succeeds, each individual sector occupied by the player is
evaluated for revoult. Troops on sector will reduce chance of revolt.
So you can defend your important secors by arming civilians on those sectors.

If the sector revolts, all troops are killed, and the instigating
player gains control of the sector. 

NOTE, only sectors that are combatible to you can revolt.
