NAME
   land [1] -- land a ship
 
SYNTAX
   land <#shipnum | ship types> [ <x,y> | #<shipnum>]

DESCRIPTION
  This command lands ships on planets or one some types of ships. To 
do so the ship must be closer than 45 distance units away from the planet 
or ship it is trying to land on. 

  This maneuver costs an amount of fuel proportional to the mass of the
ship (and the gravitational field of the planet below if landing on a planet). 
When landing on a planet, if the ship does not have enough fuel it will either
crash or refuse to try landing. Crashing will give damage to the planet 
in proportion to the mass of the ship, the gravitational field of the planet,
and the amount of destructive capacity the ship happens to be carrying.
If ship is damaged, it got also chance (equal to damage %) to crash 
when it is trieing to land.

  Ships can be transported by other ships provided hanger space is
available. The hanger space is the total size of ships which can be
carried. The mothership and the ships it is carrying move as
one unit. Ships may be debarked by using the 'launch' command.
You can see which ships are landed on your motherships by changing
scope to the mother ships and using report/stock. Landin in hanger
will not cost actionpoints.

  If a mothership is destroyed for any reason, all loaded ships are 
also eliminated. If a ship gets captured, all ships on board are also captured.

Land based ships(a, P, G for example) can only be loaded if the mothership
is landed on the same planet and occupied the same sector. A ship may
not be loaded if it is 'on' (see order) and, as cargo, cannot be turned on.
