LASERS                  Galactic Bloodshed                      LASERS


CONCEPT
  lasers -- ships may mount combat lasers for use in battle.

DESCRIPTION
  
   Some ships may be permitted to mount combat lasers at time
of construction. Race require a laser tech to do that.
A ship which has a laser mounted may optionally
use these for firing instead of the normal guns. Unlike guns,
lasers use fuel instead of destruct to attack with. Two points
of fuel is equivalent to 1 light gun. The player must also have a
crystal mounted to use the fuel for attacking.

   There is no limit to the amount of fuel that may used in
an attack. However, there is a technological stability limit,
beyond which crystal damage may result, or even an explosion.

Ship explosion is determined by the formula:
	Explosion if rand(0, strength) > ship tech/2.

A 100 technology ship may fire up to 50 strength points safely, a
200 tech ship 100, etc. Pushing it beyond this limit may result
in a matter/anti-matter explosion!

Crystals may damage before they explode a ship. The chances of
damage (and hence an automatic dismount and loss of the crystal)
is determined by
	Damaged if rand(0, strength) > ship tech/4.

A ship will only fire lasers if told to do so. This is done using
the order command 'order <ship> laser on <default strength>'.
The laser may be turned off with 'order <ship> laser off'. If the
laser is set on, then executing the 'fire' command uses lasers
instead of normal weapons.

Lasers may be set to 'focus' or 'non-focus' mode by using
'order <ship> focus <on/off>'. In focused mode, the entire salvo will
either hit or miss (based onthe hit probability), while in non-
focused mode each strength point of the salvo is evaluated for hit or
miss.

Technology limits on functional crystal ranges are proportional to
the amount of damage on the ship. Heaviliy damaged ships may
find their crystals breaking at lower limits.

Command 'ship' line 'safe' will tell you maximum salvo ship can 
fire without chance of breaking the crystal.
