NAME
   load [0] -- load/unload commodities to/from a ship

SYNTAX
   load <#shipnum> <commodity> <amount>

DESCRIPTION
  The load command is used for the resupplying of ships, and the disembarking
of colonies.  

  If no arguments are specified, the program will prompt the user for:

  #shipnum -- What ship to load from/to

 d|c|r|f|x|m -- specify destruction, crew, resources, fuel,
military or crystals to load/ unload.  Destruction, resources and 
fuel are taken from that user's stockpiles, while people are taken 
from the sector the ship is landed on.  If the ship is docked with 
another ship and not a planet, the tranfers will be direct.

  amount -- the amount to load (if negative, the amount will be subtracted).
This must be within certain bounds: the maximum cargo capacity of each ship,
unless one or both of the ships are shuttles.  Shuttles are unique in that
their design allows cargo to be strapped to their hull, and thus they can
actually hold more cargo than the maximum.  An overloaded shuttle cannot,
however, take off or land until it jettisons its excess. If no amount argument
is specify, the maximum available of the commodity will be loaded on board.

  If the ship is neither landed at a planet nor docked with another vessel,
the player can't load/unload its cargo / passengers.
