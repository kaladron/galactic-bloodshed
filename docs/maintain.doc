MAINTAIN                Galactic Bloodshed                      MAINTAIN


CONCEPT
  maintain -- Money is needed to pay troops and ships.

DESCRIPTION
  Money is needed to pay the costs of troops and ships each update.
Maintanence costs are deducted from the player's treasury, and if
funds are not available in the treasury, the deficit is deducted
from the race's morale.

  Each ship must be paid an amount equal to it's build cost if there
is non-military crew on board the ship (robot ships, some civilian ships 
and 'mothballed' ships do not pay this cost). Each troop, whether on a ship
or planet costs an additional $1 to maintain.
