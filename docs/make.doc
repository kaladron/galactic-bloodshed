NAME
   make [0] -- This commands a factory to make a specific ship type.

SYNTAX
   make <ship type>

DESCRIPTION
   In order to build ships, a factory must be programmed to produce the
desired type of ship. For example,  if a factory is to produce explorers,
the player must issue the command 'make e'.

   The make with a ship argument can only be issued to offline factories.
Once online, the ship design is set.

   If no argument is specified, the command will list the characteristics
of the ship type being produced. These characteristics can be altered
via the 'modify' command.
