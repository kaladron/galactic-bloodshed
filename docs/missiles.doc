CONCEPT
  missile -- interplanetary ballistic missiles

DESCRIPTION
  Missiles are a special ship type. They must be constructed in
a factory. The strength of a missile in an attack is dependent
on it's destruct payload. 

  Missiles attack during the segments. When a missile arrives
at it's destination it is detonated and damage to the target
is evaluated. The missile is destroyed.

  To attack with a missile, the destination must be ordered.
The destination is either a ship or a planet. If the
destination is a planet, the player can order the sector for
the missile to land on by using 'order <missile> impact <x,y>'.
