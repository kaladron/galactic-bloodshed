NAME
   mobilize [1] -- Increase military mobilization in sectors

SYNOPSIS
   mobilize <new quota>

DESCRIPTION
  This command sets quotas for mobilization in sectors, for the production
of `destructive capacity' which represents weapons in GB.

  The `mobilization' of a sector represents its military readiness; the
greater the percentage (up to 100), the higher the mobilization.  
Sectors that are mobilized produce quantities of destructive capacity
according to the degree of mobilization and the amount of resource 
deposits in the sector.

  This command only sets a quota, it does not do any actual work.  
Mobilization will be built up by the citizenry a small amount at a time
as the population works to organize things and set up factories 
and shelters and so forth.  Each mobilization point on each sector (depends
on game settings) costs 0.1 resource points to produce.  This amount is
deducted from the resource points available on the planet. Planet need to
have at least 1 resource before mobilization can rise.
