NAME
   modify [0] -- modify attributes of a ship being designed at a factory.

SYNTAX
   modify <attribute> <value>

DESCRIPTION
    Once a ship design has been specified for a factory, you may alter
the design attributes to suit your needs. Each attribute is compared to
the 'standard' design and a cost for producing the ship is evaluated
based on these attributes. Specifically, the following attributes may
be altered:

	armor, size, crew, fuel, cargo, destruct, speed, hyperdrive.

along with the special modification commands below.

   The modify command reports the current cost of producing the ship
type at the factory. 
   A base mass is also computed, the mass of the ship with nothing loaded 
on board. Each point of armor has a mass of 1 while each gun and point 
of size has a mass of 1/10.

Special systems:
	laser - A player can mount/dismount combat lasers by using
		'modify laser'

	CEWs  - A player can modify 'confined energy weapon' parameters.
		A CEW is assumed to be active if it has strength. To
		specify a CEW strength do 'mod cew strength <strength>'.
		To modify the CEW range do 'mod cew range <range>'.

	primary - A player may modify the primary gun caliber and strength with
		'mod primary strength <new strength>' and
		'mod primary caliber <light/medium/heavy>'.
		A particular ship type have a limit to the maximum gun caliber.

	secondary - Same as for primary except the word 'secondary' is used.
		Some ships may not have secondary gun systems.
