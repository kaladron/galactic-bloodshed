NAME
   mount [0] -- mount a crystal into a ship's hyperdrive.
   dismount [0] -- dismount a crystal from the hyperdrive.

SYNTAX
   mount <ship>
   dismount <ship>

DESCRIPTION  
   Normally, a ship requires a waiting period before a hyperspace
jump can be executed. This requires powering up the drive for
some period of time. However, the charge-up time can been bypassed
if a player has a crystal mounted. The effect of a crystal also
allows the ship to jump farther and more fuel efficiently than
for a ship without a crystal mounted.
   Laser guns also requires mounted crystal in ship.

   In order to mount a crystal, the player can change scope to the
ship which is to have a crystal mounted, or specify the ship's
number. The ship must have a crystal on board. A crystal can be 
dismounted using the 'dismount' command.
