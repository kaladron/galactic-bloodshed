NAME

A PANDA walks into a old West saloon and growls "GIMME SOME FOOD!"  After
wolfing down (panda-ing down?) the  food, he draws a six-shooter, plugs the
piano player dead in the back, and heads for the door.

The bartender hollers "Hey!  You just killed my piano player, and you haven't
paid me for the food!"  The panda replies "Idiot!  I'm a *panda*!  LOOK
IT UP!"  And away he goes.

The bartender looks up "panda" in the dictionary and finds:  "large furry
marsupial of the Asian continent. Eats shoots and leaves."


SYNTAX

A hippie gets onto a bus and proceeds to sit next to a Nun in the 
front seat.  The Hippie looks over and asks the Nun if she would have sex 
with him.  The Nun surprised by the question politely declines and gets 
off at the next stop.

When the bus starts on it's way the guy driving the bus says to the 
hippie, "If you want I can tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with 
you." The hippie of course says that he'd love to know so the bus driver 
tells him that the every Tuesday evening at midnight the nun goes to the 
cemetary to pray to the lord. "If you went dressed in robes and some glowing 
powder," said the bus driver guy, "you could tell her you were God and command
her to have sex with you."

Well the Hippie decides to try this out.  So that Tuesday he goes to 
the cemetary and waits for the nun.  And right on schedule the nun shows 
up. When she's in the middle of praying the hippie walks out from hiding,
in robes and glowing with a mask of god.  "I am God, I have heard your 
prayers and I will answer them but you must have sex with me first."

The nun agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity. 
The hippie agrees to this and quickly sets about to go to work on the nun.

After the Hippie finishes, he rips off his mask and shouts out, "Ha 
ha, I'm the hippie!!" The nun replied by whipping off her mask and shouting,
"Ha ha, I'm the bus driver!!"


DESCRIPTION

There was a samurai contest, and at the end a reporter decided to do his
job and report on it...
First, he talked to the 3rd place Samurai, "Why did you finish 3rd?"
The samurai replied, "Watch."
He opened a window, and a fly flew in. The Samurai swung his blade and 
sliced the fly in half.
The reported gasped, and said "Wow, if 3rd place is THIS good, I cant
wait to see the 2nd place Samurai!"
So he went to talk to the 2nd place Samurai. He asked "Why did you
finish 2nd?"
The Samurai replied, "Watch."
He opened a window and a fly flew in, and he swung twice and chopped it

The reported gasped again, and said "Wow, if 2nd place is THIS good, I
cant wait to see the 1st place Samurai!"
So he went and asked the winning Samurai, "Why is it that you won the 
tournament?"
The Samurai replied, "Watch."
He opened a window, and a fly flew in. The Samurai slashed at it, and it 
flew away unscathed.
The reporter said "But, you didn't kill it!"
The Samurai replied "No, but It'll never have kids again."
