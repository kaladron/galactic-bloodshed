SCOPE   			Galactic Bloodshed			SCOPE


CONCEPT: scope

  Scope represents the operative scope of certain commands.  The
operative scope (displayed along with AP's in the user's prompt, and changed
with cs) is similar to the tree-like directory level structure found in
most computer systems, with the root directory being a universe
scope followed by the various stars, followed by the planets orbiting these
stars.  The scope can also represent a single ship.

  Commands are affected by the scope in a different manner than that which
operating systems treat their directory structure.  For example, if
the current scope is that of a star, the command report, if given with
no arguments, will prompt reort of each ship orbiting that
star. If the scope was the universal scope, report would prompt each 
ship everywhere that the player owns.

  Many commands will work very differently, or not at all in certain scopes.

  The syntax of a scope, when prompted for, is thus:

	path = : | #shipnum | /path | ../path | name | 
		 path/name

  The shell will interpret a `:' as meaning the object of the current
scope (star, planet, or ship).

  A `/' at the beginning of the string represents the root.  It could be
followed by a star name, or not, to represent the upper, interstellar, level.

  A `..' or `.' represents the scope just above the current scope.

  `#shipnum' represents that ship.  A number by itself will be
interpreted as meaning a star or planet name.

  Specifying a name means to move down to that star or planet.
