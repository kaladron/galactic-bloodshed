NAME
   scrap [0] -- junk a ship

SYNTAX
   scrap <#shipnum>

DESCRIPTION
  Scrap allows users to reclaim the resources consumed in building
a ship or object.  Because of labor costs, only 50% of the original cost of
the ship/object can be reclaimed.

  Upon scrapping the ship, its reclamation value plus any commodities it may
have in its hold, are added to the stockpiles of the planet it is on. If ship
is docked with an another ship, commodities up to equal of free space of 
another ship can be reclaimed. 

 If the ship is not landed, no resources may be reclaimed.
