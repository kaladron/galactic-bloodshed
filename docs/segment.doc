SEGMENT                        Galactic Bloodsched	        	SEGMENT


CONCEPT: movement segment

	A movement segment (or a move seg) is a procedure during which the
server updates the positions of all ships in the game based on their
current orders.  For example, if you have a ship ordered to move toward
a particular star, planet, or ship, this process moves your ship closer
based upon the ship's speed.  You'll receive messages from the server
when you arrive at your destination, at which time your ship stops moving.
	Repairs also occur at move segs.  This means that everytime there
is a move seg, any of your ships which are currently trying to repair them-
selves, regardless of how they incurred damage, will have their damage
percent reduced by some amount.
