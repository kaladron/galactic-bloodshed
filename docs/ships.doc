Spore Pod
 
   This is a small seed pod grown by a mesomorphic race and is used 
primarily to colonize other planets. A Pod can be landed like a normal 
ship upon reaching a destination. However, a Pod can also be warmed by a 
star, causing it to explode, possibly seeding a random planet in that star 
system. Deterioration builds up in a Pod and will eventually cause it to 
decay. Pods usually last around four updates.


Super Pod

   Super pod is like normal pod except it is slightly faster and 
seeds sectors in star system three times more likely.


Toxic Waste Container

    This is a sealed container used to store environmental poisons.
When toxicity of a planet becomes too high, constructing one of these
containers will reduce the poison level by 20%. If the container is
breached, however, the toxic waste inside it will escape.


Factory

    A Factory is built to produce other ships. To see a list of ships which 
must be built in a Factory, see the help topic 'build'. After being 
built, descend to the ship's scope and specify the ship type this Factory 
will be able to produce with the 'make' command. The stats of the ship to 
be produced can then be modified by using the 'modify' command. Finally, 
the Factory must ordered online with the 'order' command. Once activated
it cannot be turned off, nor can the specification of the ships it is to
manufacture be altered in any way. 
    A Factory is built with 48% damage. This represents the time it will
take to start up production. Damage will repair itself during movement 
segments automatically. To begin repairing however the ship must first be 
ordered 'on'.
    See 'help build' for more information regarding factories.


Quarry

    This ship is used to mine resources from a sector. The amount of 
resources per update mined from a sector with a Quarry is five.
    This disadvantage of Quarries is not only that they will reduce
the fertility of a sector by the amount of resources produced, but they 
also will turn the sector into waste and increase the toxicity on the 
planet.
    Mining requires two fuel per update.
NOTE:  This is useful ship only if resource depocity is infinite, so newbie
ask deity about that before build any quarrys.


Weapons Plant
    
    This installation produces destruct. Players feed the plant resources 
and fuel, and these are converted into destruct during each update. Each 
destruct produced costs one fuel and one resource point. The maximum 
amount of destruct a fully manned and undamaged plant can produce in one 
update is given by the owner's current technology divided by two.
    This ship is built with 72% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Space Port

    This represent a facility set up for merchant shipping. This is its sole 
function and therefore has little armor and no weapons. In order to buy 
or sell from a planet, you must have one of these, or a ship with port 
abilities in an undamaged state there. Other than the Space Port, the 
only other ships available to conduct merchant transactions are: @, H, and S.
    This ship is built with 72% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Governmental Center

    This represents the seat of government of an entire civilization.
Although superficially a ship, it is not designed to be moved; if your
capitol is not landed on a planet, it produces no action points. However
it can be launched and landed like any other ship should an emergency 
arise. If a capitol is destroyed another one must be designated with the 
'capitol' command. Note that it is possible to maintain more than one 
government center; this has no benefit beyond serving as a backup in the 
case of destruction of the current capitol.
    This ship is built with 72% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Ground Telescope

    This is a ground-based astronomical facility. It is able to survey
the nearest planets for mapping purposes. The tech level of a race 
determines the telescope's range at build time. Ranges for telescopes 
built before the next update are listed in a race's profile.
    Usage: order i aim <target planet>	 

Space Plow

    This type of ship allows you to increase the fertility of sectors.
Once activated and given a move command (see the command 'order' for more 
help), a fully manned and undamaged plow will increase the 
fertility of each sector traversed by 10%. If it reaches the north or 
south of the planet map, it will bounce off and continue. There is also
a jump option to move plow automaticly into own low fertility sector,
when sector reaches fertility ordered with limit command.
See also how to use stockpile (help order).
    The Space Plow uses two fuel per update. Plowing can increase the 
toxicity level on a planet.


Shuttle

    This is a small, short-range spacecraft, intended for exploration 
and for shuttling things between ground and orbit. This ship is also 
useful for assembling other ships in space, as resources can be transferred 
from another ship using the load command until it is carrying more than 
the maximum cargo. The Shuttle, however, cannot take off or land with 
this extra cargo. Shuttles are one of the few classes of ships that can
construct other ships.


The Mighty Dhuttle

	Approximately ten years ago scientists found a design of an alien
ship from a distant planet around star Orion. After months of decoding
engineers were able to construct the ship, which resembles very much our
shuttle. It is believed, though, that this dhuttle is a design of an extinct
race that was superior to us in technology. Dhuttle has one mighty light
gun for defence and attack purposes and it has no need for armor
whatsoever.

	There are two notable differences between shuttles and dhuttles. 
A shuttle makes normal marks of rocketlaunch on the ground when it is launched
but dhuttle engraves a certain pattern to the earth. Big thing here is that
the exhaust pipes of both designs are the same.

      This pattern made by a dhuttle is a triangle in center of which you
can perceive letters HUT. Two points of the triangle have also letters. On
one point of the triangle letters form a word GEM and on the other one a
word of Jurmut. However, in the last year there have been reports of a
word on the third point also. This third word has reported to have a form
of Ix, Hitchhiker, Romans or Turtles. It seems that the final form of the
third word is not yet fixed, which, in fact, implies that this alien race
is not extinct but lives somewhere in the galaxy... 

	The other difference is a very special feature. The noise caused
by a dhuttlelaunch sounds like cry: 'Creepy will return!'



Bunker

    A heavily fortified position. Use it to store supplies and AFVs
in, as well as offering a haven for ships.
    This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Dome

    This ship can be used to increase sector efficiencies. At maximum crew 
the efficiency an undamaged Dome can increase the efficiency by 5% per 
update. A Dome must be switched on to be effective. If a Dome is set to 
autoscrap (with the 'order' command), the Dome will be automatically 
scrapped upon reaching a sector efficiency of 100%. There is a jump option
for dome to make it automaticly jump into own low efficiency sector, when
sector reaches efficiency ordered with limit command. See also how to use
stockpile (help order).
    A dome uses one resource per update.


Space Probe

    This device is used to sight positions of enemy fleets. The ship is 
robotic and requires no crew, but reports data from its explorations to 
the building race as if it were manned. It is extremely fast and can be
useful for analyzing the strategic deployments of enemy ships. 


Colonizer
   
   A unarmed, lightly armored recon ship, with a large crew compartment,
and ample resource space, this ship is perfect for scouting out prospective
homes for your race.
   This ship is built with 20% damage.  Construct must be completed manually.


Dust Canister

    This is a small canister of light-absorbing dust. When launched it
will spread into the atmosphere of the planet, lowering its ambient
temperature by ten degrees per update. Multiple Dust Canisters have a 
cumulative effect, but the temperature of a planet can not be lowered by 
more than 100 degrees. This can be used to terraforming purposes, when the 
temperature is too high for comfort. 
    The dust disperses after 80 turns.


Greenhouse Gases

    This device produces large amounts of greenhouse gases when launched 
into the atmosphere of a planet, raising the temperature near the planet 
surface by ten degrees per update. Launching more than one will warm the 
planet faster, but the temperature of a planet can not be raised by more 
than 100 degrees. This can be used to terraforming purposes, when the 
temperature is too low for comfort.
    The gases disperse after 80 turns.


Explorer

    This is a small and fast exploration craft with some armor. 
It has increased range over shuttle and it's the smalest shiptype 
capable to jump. It is more hevily armed than shuttle. This is not a ship
to tangle with warships, although it is rather ideal for armed recon.
     This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed manually.

Missile

    This weapon can be used to attack enemy planets or ships. In order to
attack with a missile, they must be launched and then given a destination.
If the destination is a ship it will detonate upon reaching the enemy 
ship. If the destination is a planet, the missile will impact on the 
designated sector. See help on 'order' for designating missile impact
coordinates. A missile may be designated to impact a specific sector, or 
may be allowed to randomly hit the planet. 
    A missile aimed for a planet will automatically switch its target to any 
Planetary Defense Networks protecting the planet. The only automatic 
defense against missiles is the ABM battery.


Space Telescope 

    This is a space-based astronomical facility, with fuel and engines
for launching it into orbit. It has a much longer range than a 
ground-based telescope. The tech level of a race determines the
telescope's range at build time. Ranges for telescopes built before the 
next update are listed in a race's profile.


AFV

    This machine is a land based Armored Fighting Vehicle. These type of 
ships may fire on other ships if adjacent. The may also bombard adjacent 
sectors. AFVs may only attack other landed ships. AFVs can be moved using
the 'walk' command.
NOTE: These are weaker than they look.


Mine Sweeper
    
    A medium armored and armed ship, capable of seeking (automatically) 
out mines and destroying them before other ships come in contact with
them. The Sweeper is not particularly fast, but it have kind of shotgun
cannons. These cannons give better hit probability against mines than
cannons of any other ship. The sweeper is best used when loaded into a
faster ship and sent out before exploring a unknown system.
    This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Mine Fields 

    This device is a proximity mine, exploding on contact with enemy
ships or, if set with the 'order' command, showering them with deadly 
radiation. Affected ships, when irradiated, can become periodically 
immobile; each turn, an affected ship's crew is reduced by 20%.
    The mine can be armed/disarmed with 'order', and its trigger radius 
also altered with the 'order' command. 
    Alien space mines are difficult to detect. They are invisible on the
solar system maps but can be detected with the `tactical' command. 
Their precise locations may be difficult to triangulate. They also possess
a high defense strength since they are small objects and difficult to hit
nonetheless find. A Mine Sweeper can facilitate rooting out these 
dangerous surprises.
    Mines are triggered by ships moving inside of their assigned trigger 
radius, or by owner using detonate command.


Light Carrier
	
    This is a low tech - small carrier, usefully for transporting shuttles
or domes to your colonies.  They have light armor, and only minimal guns for
defensive purposes.  
  This ship is built with 48% damage.  Construct must be completed manually.


Terraforming Device

    This device alters the surface of a planet to better suit its 
owner. Once activated and given a move command (see the command 'order' 
for more help), the Terraforming Device moves each update to a new position, 
altering sectors as it goes. 
    It will move first, then terraform, so that it will not destroy the 
sector on which it was built. Any sector terraformed will have its 
efficiency and mobilization count reduced to 0. Terraformers will 
terraform sector owned by other players but civilians and military are not 
destroyed, owner is not changed and victims receives warning message.
'Gas'sectors can not be terraformed to any other type of sector, but not 
vice versa. Terraforming requires three fuel per update. Terraforming can 
increase the toxicity level of a planet.


Atmosphere Processor

    This is a large machine (of the type in _Aliens_) that sucks in
the atmosphere of a planet, converting it to the type of air preferred by 
its owner. You must load crew into these objects for them to 
operate. The device also must be activated with the order command. 
Larger planets take longer to convert than smaller planets.
    The Processor uses three fuel units per turn.


Anti-Ballistic Missile Battery

    This unit represent a battery of guns which can be used to
attempt to down incoming alien missiles. If activated, each battery
will fire at the predesignated salvo strength at each missile in orbit
around the planet it is based upon during each update. The defensive fire 
is evaluated after missile movement, but before impact is evaluated. 
ABMs represent a last line of defense against missile attacks and are
executed automatically. The more batteries a planet has the more chance
of intercepting and incoming missile.
    This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Destroyer

    This ship is the smallest of the combat ships. With moderate arms and 
armor, this ship can provide decent star system security at the lower 
technology levels, and later can be produced en masse to fill in a fleet. 
It is always a good choice for escort duty.
    This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Tanker

    This ship can carry large amounts of fuel and moderate amounts of
other commodities. In addition, it can also collect fuel at a high rate,
which is one fifth of tanker's fuel capacity, by orbiting a gas giant.
They have very small gunnery strengths and light armor, but since they are
relatively huge they have lot of staminal strenghth against attacks.


Cargo Ship

    A basic all-purpose transport ship, a cargo ship has long range 
capability, but little defensive capability. Escort ships are a definite 
must when using these ships in volatile areas.


Space Station

    This is an orbital installation useful as a military depot as well 
as a perimeter planetary defense base. They do not pack heavy firepower, 
though, and have little armor. It can build any ships that warships or 
shuttles can build.
    Stations are unusual in that they can repair themselves for free,
without charging resources. Ships docked with or landed on a station can 
also take advantage of this feature.
    This ship is built with 72% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Space Habitat

    This is a residential platform, a space colony. It can be used to
manufacture other ships, as well as safeguard your race against extinction,
if you choose to send it into interstellar space as an insurance measure. 
Habitats can build any ship a warship is able to, and may also build 
these ship types: X, H, S, O, M, @, :, F, T and W. Both Factories (F) 
and Weapon Plants (W) may be operated in the hanger area of a Habitat. 
They are equipped with defensive strength arms and armor.
    Habitats also have sophisticated manufacturing and refining equipment,
enabling the Habitat to convert fuel into resources (typically at 20 fuel
per resource), in proportion to the number of people staffing it. To
facilitate the conversion, they also gather fuel at gas giants at a high
rate, normally 200 fuel per update. The Habitat must be switched on with
the order command before it will produce resources. 
    Habitats are the only ships in which citizens feel comfortable enough to 
reproduce freely.
    This ship is built with 72% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Fighter Group

   The Fighter Group is a quick, high power weapon when utilized correctly. 
Their short range necessitates transport ships, but the tactical advantage 
these ships can create make them indispensable assets in combat. Fighter 
groups represent up to five individual craft at full strength. This 
interpretation, however, is unimportant with the scale of the game.


Gamma Ray Laser

    This device shoots medium gun shots or deadly streams of radiation at 
its target when fired. It uses destructive capacity in the same manner for
both guns. Radiation is not accumulated in target ships; if a ship's
radiation level is 10, only a more powerful shot from the laser may 
increase the radiation level. A weaker shot will have no effect at all.
    Radiation does not kill immediately, but will kill off 20% of the ship's 
population each update. Each movement segment, a ship may have a chance  
of becoming inactive due to the radiation levels in the ship. 
Gamma Ray Laser is second generation of planetary defence guns after @.
    This ship is built with 72% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Space Mirror

    This is a large plane of reflecting material, suitable for altering 
the ambient temperature of a planet if aimed at one (via the 'order'
command). The intensity of the reflected beam can also be set with 'order'. 
The intensity is the maximum temperature rise of the planet in degrees; 
this amount may be reduced by damage to the Mirror or by range.
    A Space Mirror may also be used as a weapon if aimed at a ship. The 
damage done to the ship is proportional to the intensity set on the Mirror 
and inversely related to the target's size and the range to the target. 
    This ship also has attitude jets for maneuvering. 
    This ship is built with 72% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Cruiser

    This ship is a medium class escort/battle vessel. Although without the 
range of the Interceptor, the Cruiser boasts heavy caliber firepower and 
substantially more armor. These ships can provide a strong foundation for
a powerful fleet.
    This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Interceptor

    This ship is a step above the Destroyer. Although equipped with 
the same armor, the Interceptor has more firepower and excellent 
range via its large fuel capacity, which can even outdistance 
a standard Cruiser class ship. An Interceptor is very fast, it's like
the 'Porche' of the battlefield and an excellent choice for 
lengthy, but potentially dangerous patrols.
    This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Lander

    A heavily armored planetary assault ship. This carries a large crew,
with decent hanger space for transporting AFVs. With its heavy armor it
can successfully survive planetary defense fire enough to establish a 
significantly large landing party on a planet. It also carries plenty of 
firepower for bombarding runs. The Lander is quite slow, however.
    This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Orbital Assault Platform

    This is a huge station-like construction, bristling with firepower.
Its horribly impressive weaponry system makes it useful for enslaving 
recalcitrant worlds (with the 'enslave' command). It can also be used
for constructing other ships as can shuttles and habitats, however it
cannot reproduce citizens or manufacture resources.
    An OAP must be built in space and is too large to be landed on a planet.
    This ship is built with 72% damage. Construction must be completed
manually.


Planetary Defense Network

    These are powerful, well armored third generation planetary defence (after
gamma ray lasers)  which prevent enemy players to fire at planets as long 
as they are present. Before a player may attack sectors with orbiting ships, 
all planetary defense systems must be eliminated.
    This ship is built with 72% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Audio-Vibatory-Physio-Molecular Transport Device

    This device has a hopper for the loading of material. When it detects
the presence of something in the hopper, it will transport this material 
into the hopper of its target device. The target device can be specified
with the 'order' command.
    You should specify the number of the receiving Transporter. If the
target ship is set to `0' cargo will not be transported anywhere and will
remain in the hopper. Both the sending and target Transporters must be 
landed and undamaged to transport material.
    This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Battleship

    Although not quite the mighty Dreadnaught, the Battleship is the basic 
heavy class combat ship. With its excellent armor and heavy firepower, 
this ship works well for general-purpose assaults, and fleet duty.
    This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Dreadnaught

    This ship is the largest and best armored combat vessel. With twice the 
gunpower of the Battleship and heavy-duty armor, the Dreadnaught makes an 
excellent flagship for any navy.
    This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.


Carrier

    Carriers have huge hangers, enabling them to carry and support many 
companion ships. Any real battle group will be equipped with one of
these massive machines. They are not amazingly armored, but are armed about
equivalent to a Battleship. These ships are so large, they can not land on 
planets and must be built in space.
    This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed 
manually.
