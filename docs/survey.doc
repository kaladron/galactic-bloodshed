SURVEY			Galactic Bloodshed			SURVEY


NAME
   survey [0] -- more detailed survey of planet, sector, star

SYNTAX
   survey <xlow:xhi,ylow:yhi or x,y>

DESCRIPTION
  survey gives a different report depending on what scope it is used on.
The possible scopes are sector, planet, and star.

Census on sector

>  x,y cond/type  owner race eff mob frt  res  mil popn ^popn xtals
>  0,0   o   #        2    0  15  10  34  205    0  517     0 

  x,y: map coordinates on sector
 cond: desicnation of sector appearance (after terraforming, nukeing etc.)
 type: designation of sector (land, water, etc)
owner: owner of sector
 race: original owner (startingsectors only)
  eff: efficiency (%age it is built up) of the sector
  mob: % mobilization of the citizens in that sector
  frt: fertility of the sector (supports people)
  res: resource deposits in the sector
 popn: population of the sector
^popn: maximum population the sector can support
xtals: this says yes if sector contains crystals (only if you have crystaltech)


Census on planet

Example planet Ergos:

>Ergos
>gravity   x,y absolute     x,y relative to Artemis
>   0.30   193860.0,148066.4     -289.4,  -772.0

  gravity: gravity of the planet (relative to Earth normal)
  x,y absolute: coordinates relative to the Center of the Universe
  x,y relative..: coordinates relative to the planet's primary


>======== Planetary conditions: ========
>atmosphere concentrations:

>         CO2 01%(01%)   hydrogen 12%(12%)      temperature: -28 (-25)
>    nitrogen 02%(02%)     sulfur 01%(01%)           normal: -25
>      helium 01%(01%)      other 11%(11%)
>                     Toxicity: 14% (Stage 1, mild)
>Total planetary compatibility: 85.74%
>            Average fertility: 8
>             Average resource: 202
>              Crystal sectors: 0
>      Total resource deposits: 24343

  	======== planetary conditions: ========
  Gives the atmospheric concentrations of certain key elements in the
    planet's atmosphere: Oxygen, CO2, Methane, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Helium,
    Sulfur, surface temperature, normal temperature (without artificial
    influencing factors like space mirrors), and 'Other'.  The 'Total 
    planetary compatibility' is the difference between the weighted sum 
    of each of these characteristics and the preferences of the player 
    (expressed in parentheses after each characteristic).

>     173             92       101       1158       2901

  fuel_stock: fuel the player has managed to stockpile on the planet
  resource_stock: stockpiled resources on the planet
  dest_pot: stockpiled destructive potential on the planet (weapons)
  popltn: total population of living beings
  ^popltn: maximum number of living beings the planet can support
	(inhabited sectors only)


Census on star

Example star Artemis

>Star Artemis
>locn: 194149.437261,148838.373757
>Gravity: 455.50	Instability: 2% (stable)
>temperature class (1->10) 4
>9 planets are Larissa Gorgon Bragi Geirrod Ergos Dagon Argus Euripedes Drak 

  locn: x,y coordinates of the star from the Center of the Universe
  gravity: gravitational influence
  Instability: Stability of the star.  As stability approaches 100, the star
	will become more and more unstable.  The player must have a technology
	of 3 or more to determine the stability.
  Temperature class: How hot the star is. Hotter it is faster the pods will
		     warm.
