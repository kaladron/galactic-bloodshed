NAME
   tax [0] -- set the tax rate of a planet

SYNTAX
   tax <rate>

DESCRIPTION
  A player can generate money by 'taxing' his populations. Each planet
can be assigned a tax rate. In order to set the tax rate of a planet, the
player must first change scope it and tax a rate between 0 and 100 (percent).
The tax rate is then placed into the 'new' tax rate. This is the rate that
the existing rate will change towards 5% to after every update.

  The tax rate may have several effects on the production/stability of
the planet. 

Effective metabolism = race metabolism * (1-tax%/100).
Example metab 1.4 tax 30% yields 1.4 * (1-30/100) = 0.98

The amount of money generated by a planet per update is tax% * population/5.
The tax rate may adversely affect a planets in that it open the possibility
that insurgency may be used against it, which can cause revolts and
ensuing civil war.
