SYNTAX
   think <message>

DESCRIPTION
   This command is similar to "broadcast", except instead of sending your
message to everyone in the game, it sends the message to the leader of your
race and all its governors.  Note that in order to receive the message,
the leader or governor must be logged on.  This command also can only be
used to send messages to your own race.
