UPDATE                        Galactic Bloodeshed                      UPDATE


CONCEPT: update

	An update is a "glorified move seg."  Basically, everything that
happens in a move seg happens here PLUS the following:
	- Tax collecting and maintain expences paying.
	- Resource, fuel, destruction, crystal and toxic waste production.
	- Colony population growth.
	- Sector and atmosphere developing.
	- Racial technology and morale developing.
	- Ships attempting hyperspace jumps either jump or charge
	  in increments towards a level where they can jump.
	- Marketing.
	What this translates to is this:  The pace of the game depends
almost entirely on how often these updates occur.  There will always be
a given number of move segs (usually anywhere from 2 to 6) between updates,
but updates are the real pulse of the game.  Also, you should note that
the period right after updates is usually when the most frantic action in
the game takes place.
	This is important when choosing what game you wish to play in.  For
example, if you live over in Europe and the update schedule is such that
updates always occur at 4 am for you, you might want to pass on the game.
If you aren't on at updates, enemies often get the chance of jump into your
system and start attacking while you aren't on to defend yourself.  This
can have disastrous effects.

This clears up a bit what is happening during updates to TKY type ships:
* process move orders (only T and K)
* hop if sector is ready and autoscrap if hop fails
* do your things to sector
* autoscrap Y's
