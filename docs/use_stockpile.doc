STOCKPILE USAGE

TKY's will now use planetary stockpile so basicly you don't have to
load res or fuel or use thresloading with them - they'll just take
everything they need from stockpile. Anyhow because they operate
before production cycle in updates you should look after that there is
enough resources for _all_ landed ships that use stockpile (or you
could just use thresloading which is easier I think). This one thing
which might be done other way i.e. planetary production first and ship
update then. Stockpile usage can be toggled using 'order TKY
stockpile [on|off]'.
