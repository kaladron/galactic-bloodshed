SYNTAX
   victory [count]

DESCRIPTION
 This command shows how close players are to winning the game.  It
sorts the player list by proximity to winning, so the object of
the game is to get your name to the top of the list. :-)

 If count is specified, only the top count players are displayed.
If count is omitted, all players are shown.

Here are the winning conditions, where X and Y are settable for
each game:

(1) "Control" of a planet is more than 50% occupancy of same.
(2) The first player to control X percent of all planets for Y
    consecutive updates wins.
(3) Any other players who control X percent of all planets at that
    time also win.

Note: Asteroids do not count in the victory totals.
