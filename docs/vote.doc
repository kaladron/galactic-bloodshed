NAME
   vote [0] -- Vote on a Galactic Bloodshed issue

SYNTAX
   vote [issue  [ option ]]

DESCRIPTION
   Issues - update
	Options - 'go' or 'wait'
	You may vote go on the 'update' issue using the command
		"vote update go".
	This tells the server that you are done doing whatever it is that
	you want to do, and are just basically waiting for the next update.
	If you have voted to go and think of something else that you would
	like to do before an update, you can 'vote update wait'.
	After each update, your update vote is reset to the wait state.

	If and when EVERYONE (not counting Deities or Guests) votes to
	"go"; an update will be done.

	This is most likely to be used during the early portion of the
	game when not much is happening and most people are just waiting
	for supplies to build up.  This gives the players a sort of
	"variable" input to the update process.  The update interval
	length chosen by the Deity then becomes a maximum length, with
	a shorter interval occuring when everyone votes to go.
