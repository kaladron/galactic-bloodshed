NAME
   zoom [0] -- declare zoom values
 
SYNTAX
   zoom (amount) <x,y>

DESCRIPTION
  This command allows users to alter the scale used in an orbit display.
The lower the number, the larger the display will be.

  Amount can be specified in one of two ways: a floating-point format,
in which case the amount will be the amount given, or an i/j format, in
which case the amount will be the numerator (i) divided by the denominator (j).

 The optional argument changes the `lastx,lasty' coordinates to the specified
coordinates, in case the player desires a closeup of an area he has not 
explored yet.

  At a zoom scale of 1.0, the display will be equal to the screen size.  At
a scale of greater than 1.0, the display will be smaller than the screen;
smaller than 1.0, and the screen will zoom in to the displayed map.

  Display is centered around the current `lastx,lasty' coordinates (see
orbit).

  At game start, the zoom value is declared as 1.0.

   There are two zoom factors, one for 'star' level, and one for 'universe' 
level. You can specify the 'lastx, lasty' for the universe level with 
the 'center <star>' command.
