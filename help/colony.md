# COLONY

CONCEPT: Colonies and Planetary Maintenance

  To start a colony, you must first build a ship.  Several ships are excellent 
for colony development, but this really depends on your racial characteristics.
For example, an explorer can only carry few crew members.
Shuttles do well for this purpose since they are cheap.

   At the beginning of the game it is important to get your race
established on the several planets in your solar system and get a good
resource base, then expand to other solar systems.

   Once your ship is in orbit around the planet you must land it on a sector
there.  Your race has a few sector types that they like; these are listed in
your racial profile.  You should survey a few sectors to see which can
actually hold your colony.  Also look for a sector with lots of resources.
Every update sector efficiency increases if it is inhabited by race who got
compatibility with that sectortype, so it's a good idea to occupy
as much compatible sectors you can, even if your population will not 
yet survive that sector.

   Population of a sector increases (or decreases) toward the sector's
max population value, so take this into account.  A sector that is a
wasteland will kill 90% of its population every update.

   Land your ship there, and use load to unload some people.  Congratulations,
you have a new colony.

   Most of the time your colony planets will be less than ideal places to
live.  There are some devices to help you terraform your new planet.  One of
these is the atmosphere processor, which sucks in the atmosphere and converts
it to one more suitable to you. If your planet is too hot to begin with, 
a canister of dust launched into orbit will absorb sunlight and make it 
cooler.  This has an added effect of being able to make a planet 
inhospitable to another race.

   Efficiency on a sector represents how "built up" the area is.  This number
increases as time goes by, according to how many people are there to do the
work.  Efficiency, in turn, controls how many people the sector can support.
The maximum population is the sum of the maximum sector populations of every
sector.  As the planet's population increases toward this figure,
environmental conditions, represented by toxicity, worsen.  Toxicity also
affects the maximum population of the sectors on the planet, sometimes
causing an increased death rate and massive damage to the planet beyond a
certain threshold (85).

   To deal with this you have to build toxic waste canisters.  Each one can
hold up to 20 units of waste, but can be built with less.  The canisters, if
breached, add their waste back to the planet.  Even orbiting them will not
alleviate this problem; you must send them to another planet (preferably
someone else's.)
