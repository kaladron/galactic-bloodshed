# MONEY

## Concept
  money -- galactic credits

## Description
  Money can be used by players as a medium of exchange
and can be transferred using the 'pay' command. Money is generated by
setting tax rates at key planets using the 'tax' option. 

  Money generated from taxes, in addition to being exchangable using the 
'pay' option, can be used to increase racial technology levels using
the 'technology' option. You can buy goodies from GB Commodities Market
(see bid to get more info about this). Revolutions on planets can also be
instigated with 'insurgency'.

  Money is also used to pay maintenance costs of armies and ships.
