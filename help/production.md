## Name
   production [0] -- show latest planet production statistics

## Syntax
   production

DESCRIPTION - COMMAND
     This command will show the number of resources, fuel, crystal, 
and destruct that a planet production during the previous update.

DESCRIPTION - CONCEPT
     The amount of resources/fuel/destruct depends produced on
a planet can be determined by two methods, preset by the
game master. 

   In LIMITED resource mode the total amount of resources 
available at a planet is finite and players obtain resources by 
mining the resources. Specifically the chance of sector
producing resources during an update is the efficiency. Players
may construct 'quarry' objects which can be used to 
also mine resources. It should be noted however that quarry
objects may produce toxicity while in operation. 

   In UNLIMITED resource mode each planet has an unlimited
of available resources, and the number of resources obtained
from each sector depend on the efficiency, population, as well
as number of resource deposits. This is the 'old-method' of
resource production.
