# RACES

## Concepts

   There are bunch of programmed racial characteristics which offers 
players a large variety in capabilities. Of course, no one race
is intended to be ideal over another, and players should learn how
to optimize their particular choice. There are 9 basic characteristics
of each race:
	1) Mesomorph - A player can request to be a 'mesomorphic'
		race. They have a advantage of a only 1 sex. 
		They can also take over the bodies of their victims. A 
		well run mesomorphic player can be a formidable foe.

	2) Mass - Each race has a mass. The heavier the individual, the
		more fuel it usually takes to launch and land them.
		Heavy creatures may require more fuel to move around than
		light creatures.

	3) Birthrate - This factor (infection rate for mesos) controls
		how rapidly the population in the sector will try to
		adjust toi the maximum support of the sector. High
		values mean that the populations multiply faster.

	4) Fighting Ability - Higher values mean that the race is more
		likely to kill an alien than a lower value. Races
		with lower values will usually need to have larger
		forces to win in direct combat over a high fighting
		ability. It is important to note that this effects only
		land combat and boarding strengths, and not ship to
		ship fighting.

	5) Intelligence - The raw growth rate of technology is goverened
		by the race's intelligence. The technology increase per
		update is IQ/100. Additional technology boosts for a race
		is controlled by technology investments by the individual
		planets under the player's control.

		   Collective intelligence is related to the races total 
		population, a sort of collective intelligence. Specifically, 
		C IQ = 200* [ (2/PI) atan(population/50000)]^2. It's usually
		a good idea to take advantage of the 'technology investment'
		option to keep pace with more intelligent racial types.

	6) Adventurism - This described how often a sector's
		population wants to move and explore other sectors.
		High value tend to explore and conquer planets on their
		own more efficiently. If you have a low value, you can
		order movements with the 'move' option.

	7) Sexes - Each race has a number of sexes. This represent the
		minimum population that a sector must have in order to
		be able to reproduce. Lower values are preferable to high
		values for colonization efforts. 

	8) Metabolism - This value controls how industrious the race. Higher
		metabolism races will produce resources more rapidly than 
		lower metabolisms.

        9) Fertilize - This attribute represents the percentage chance that 
		a race will increase by one percent the fertility of any 
		sector it owns.  Any race may take advantage of space plows 
		for a similar effect, once it gets to tech level 5.
