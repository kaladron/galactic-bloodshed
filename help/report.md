# REPORT

## Name
   report [0] -- navigational ship report

## Syntax
   report <#shipnum or ship types>

## Description
  This command allows users to survey their ships.  Where `stock' gives
information about what a ship is carrying, `report' will give
information about where the ship is and where it is going.

  If given with no arguments, `report' will start with the current scope
and give reports on all ships from there down.

  Additional information about the ship can be obtained with the `examine'
command.
